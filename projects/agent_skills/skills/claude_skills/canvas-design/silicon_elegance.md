# Silicon Elegance

A design philosophy for financial data visualization rooted in Apple's ethos:

- **Minimalist Form**: Eliminate all non-essential elements. Let data breathe.
- **Restrained Color Palette**: Use monochrome base with a single accent color (e.g., deep graphite or muted silver).
- **Spatial Clarity**: Leverage generous whitespace and grid-based alignment to guide the eye.
- **Master-Level Craftsmanship**: Precision in typography, stroke weights, and alignment conveys trust and authority.
- **Visual Over Verbal**: Represent revenue, segments, and YoY growth through abstract geometric forms—circles, arcs, clean bars—labeled only with essential metrics (e.g., 'iPhone', '$94.8B').

Typography: Use Work Sans for headings (bold), IBM Plex Serif for body context if needed, and Geist Mono for financial figures.
